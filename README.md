### About  
Simple Grayscale bundles two colorschemes aimed at being easy to read and focus with. The goal is to write with as few distractions as possible!

The dark variant is simply tek256's wonderful simple-dark colorscheme with minor modifications.

Primary goal was to fork and add a light variant while fixing some minor issues I had with the dark variant.

### Installation
For vim you can do the following:  
If you're using something like vim plug you can simply add 
```
Plugin 'omakk/simple-grayscale'
```
and run `:PlugInstall` to make sure the scheme is downloaded.

otherwise you can just copy the `colors` folder to your vim colors folder (usually `~/.vim/colors/`).

Once you have the scheme just adding either of the variants as colorscheme looks like
```
colorscheme simple-dark
```
or
```
colorscheme simple-light
```
