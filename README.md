### About  
Simple Light is a colorscheme aimed at being easy to read and focus with. The goal is to write with as few distractions as possible!

### Installation
For vim you can do the following:  
If you're using something like vim plug you can simply add 
```
Plugin 'tek256/simple-dark'
```
and run `:PlugInstall` to make sure the scheme is downloaded.

otherwise you can just copy the `colors` folder to your vim colors folder (usually `~/.vim/colors/`).

Once you have the scheme just adding either of the variants as colorscheme looks like
